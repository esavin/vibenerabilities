"""The agent loop for commit-by-commit security analysis: messages -> model ->
execute tools -> repeat until finish().

With a `validator` callback the loop gains repair rounds: after a finish that
left records on disk (VULN_UPDATED, or NO_VULN with write_record calls behind
it), the validator inspects the records; if it reports problems, they are fed
back as a new user message and the agent continues (fix and finish again), up
to `repair_rounds` extra rounds. Each repair round EXTENDS the step budget by
`REPAIR_EXTRA_STEPS`, so validation feedback can never eat the steps the model
needs to fix and re-finish.

Weak-model guardrails observed on real runs (fernflower):
- narration/empty responses: a reply with text but no tool call gets a short
  user nudge pushing the model back to tools, ABORTED after
  `TEXT_ABORT_THRESHOLD` consecutive text-only replies (and a text-only reply
  at an exhausted budget falls through to the shared budget handling - grace
  round, synthesized finish or max-steps error - instead of nudging forever);
  an EMPTY reply (all tokens burned as hidden reasoning) is nudged too, and
  only aborted after `EMPTY_ABORT_THRESHOLD` consecutive empties;
- duplicate calls: an EXACT repeat of a previous (tool, arguments) pair is
  refused with an explanation instead of executing (real runs burned 5-7 steps
  re-reading the same file or re-running the same `git show --stat`);
- deadline: in the last `DEADLINE_WINDOW` steps a note rides on tool results
  and a one-time user deadline is injected (regardless of what the step did),
  so the model calls finish before the limit cuts it off;
- productive-write extension: if the budget runs out while the model is still
  successfully writing records (large path-hygiene commits touch many
  records), the budget is extended (up to `WRITE_EXTENSIONS` times) so the
  work is finished, not truncated;
- finish grace: if the budget still runs out with records already written and
  no finish, ONE extra finish-only round is granted (every other tool
  refused) - throwing away a completed record pass for a missing finish call
  wastes an entire re-run. If even that round passes without a finish call,
  the loop SYNTHESIZES the missing VULN_UPDATED verdict from the records
  actually written and still routes it through the validator/repair flow;
- output-token cuts: a tool call whose JSON was cut off by the model/gateway
  output limit (weak gateways cap at ~8k tokens without setting
  finish_reason) is refused with an explanation of the split-write technique
  (write the first half, then write_record append) instead of a bare parse
  error - real runs retried the same giant write 7-10 times until the budget
  died;
- context compaction (limits.compact_threshold_tokens > 0, e.g. the "small"
  profile): the whole message history is normally re-sent on every
  round-trip, which overflows small (~32k) context windows mid-session.
  Once a request reports prompt_tokens at/above the threshold, OLDER tool
  results are shrunk in place (the last compact_keep_groups assistant+tool
  groups stay verbatim; message structure and tool_call ids are preserved,
  so strict gateways still see a valid conversation) and each shrunken
  result carries an explicit "re-read if needed" note. A duplicate re-read
  whose previous result was compacted away is let through the duplicate
  guard, so the model can always recover content it still needs.
- provider context-limit 400s (llm.ContextOverflowError): when the gateway
  still rejects an oversized request despite compaction (e.g. a huge
  validator repair message arrives as a NEW user message that
  compact_history never touches), the loop runs escalating emergency
  passes - halve/quarter the result cap, keep only the last group verbatim,
  truncate oversized injected user messages and (last resort) the task
  brief itself - retries the request, and adapts the compaction threshold
  to the provider-reported window so later growth compacts before hitting
  it again. Only when every pass frees nothing does the error escape as an
  ERROR verdict.
